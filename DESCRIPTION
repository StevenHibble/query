Description: Keep SQL queries in separate files and manage them easily in R.
    The 'get_queries()' function finds all SQL queries in a directory and
    loads them into an R list for easy management and built-in autocomplete.
    Use the 'query()' function to run queries (either in files or stored as strings).
    Use glue-style strings to pass parameters to your queries.
